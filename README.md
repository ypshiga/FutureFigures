# FutureFigures
Hobby project to learn how to scrape images from the web, classify them, and create new images. Goals is to eventually transition to using figures from scientific journals but still looking for data source. May start with this https://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/.


Started by adapting a tutorial scraping Time magazine covers using Scrapy and examining the decadal average images [Analyze_covers](    Analyze_covers.ipynb). I then applied a k-means cluster analysis and gaussian mixture models analysis to see if similar covers clusters correspond to the decadal averages.
