# FutureFigures
Hobby project to learn how to scrape images from the web, classify them, and create new images. Focusing on figures from scientific journals.

Currently looking for data source.

May start with this https://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/.


Started by adapting a tutorial scraping Time magazine covers using Scrapy and examining the decadal average images [Analyze_covers](    Analyze_covers.ipynb). I then perform a k-means cluster analysis to see if similar covers clusters correspond to the decadal averages.
