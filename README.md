# FutureFigures
Hobby project to learn how to scrape images from the web, classify them, and create new images. 
The original goal was to eventually transition to using figures from scientific journals but never made it that far...


Started by adapting a tutorial to scrape Time magazine covers using scrapy (https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/10/12/scraping-images-with-python-and-scrapy/).  
Then continued to examine the decadal average images using this tutorial (https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/10/19/analyzing-91-years-of-time-magazine-covers-for-visual-trends/)
Finally I applied a couple simple unsupervised clustering tools (k-means and gaussian mixture models) to see if similar covers clusters could be extracted and if they related to the decadal average image trends.
